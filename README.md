# PIEProgram
an octa-translation dictionary and lexical similarity calculator for some of the most spoken languages in the Proto-Indo-European family of languages.

Have you ever looked at a language and thought to yourself “Huh, that kind of reminds me of the word for the same thing in (insert language here),” or found that learning the language you’ve been putting off for year is a lot easier than because the words look and/or sound similar? Depending on your native and target language(s), your intuitions would be correct! When it comes to most of the major languages spoken on the European continent, plus a few languages in Asia and the Middle East, a linguistic “family tree” of sorts has been uncovered by Linguists and Anthropologists alike, known as the Proto-Indo-European (PIE) family of languages. Its given this name because the root language that each is traced back to existed before the invention of writing systems, and therefore the existence of the language is (credibly) speculative. You may now be asking yourself “Okay, but who cares?” by now, however the implications of this are MASSIVE:
Languages that are vastly different from each other somehow share a common undertone of structure and sound characteristics as a result of historical processes.
Preconceived notions of certain groups of people being “different” on a foundational level can be further thrown out the window: they all share a common ancestor and therefore are culturally related.

Data like this can help inform people of languages that are lexically similar to a language they already know or are interested in, allowing them to scaffold multilingualism via only working with languages that have the highest similarity to their native tongue.

Before continuing, a word of caution feels extremely warranted: While there may be a common ancestor shared between the words of the languages in this program, it does NOT factor into account the sentence structure, nor does it place words in their full lexical context to prompt derivation in meaning. Instead, this program compares word-for-word data from the following languages: 
English, Hindi, Farsi, Spanish, French, Dutch, German, Polish, and Russian.

“Okay, but what are the categories and what do they mean?”

Nouns: People, places, things, and abstract ideas!
Abstract Noun: refers to an idea, emotion, or concept that doesn't technically exist in reality
Common Noun: refers to a general category of people/places/things, without specifics in mind
Proper Noun: refers to a specific person/place/thing that exists in reality
Collective Noun: refers to a group of things and only makes sense in the context of group reference

Verbs: Action and combining words!
Action Verb: Describes a specific action or state of being
Linking Verb: Is used to connect the subject of a sentence to a specific noun or adjective that describes it.
Stative Verb: Is used to describe a state or condition that is unlikely to change.
Transitive Verb: Is used to complete a sentence’s object and subject.

Adjectives: Descriptive traits and attributes!
Compound Adjective: A combination of two or more adjectives.
Demonstrative Adjective: Is used to describe a noun’s position in general time and/or space.
Interrogative Adjective: Modifies a noun or pronoun to ask a question
Possessive Adjective: Indicates the ownership of a trait or quality.

Prepositions: Descriptions of how you do a verb or where a noun is!
Movement Preposition: Describes the relocation of an object from one place to another. 
Manner Preposition: Describes the way in which a noun performs an action.
Time Preposition: Describes the duration of a specific action or thing.
Place Preposition: Describes the physical location of a place in relation to its surroundings.

Determiners: the minimal, nitty-gritty details!
Article Determiner: Precedes a noun to describe it as specific or generic.
Demonstrative Determiner: Introduces a noun AND identifies the subject and object of a sentence.
Possessive Determiner: Introduces a noun to indicate the ownership of a trait or quality.
Quantifier Determiner: Introduces a noun to indicate the amount of it that’s present.


“So how do I use this program?”
	The program’s use is intentionally straightforward. Simply press a button to choose a word category, then press a button for the subcategories within the new window, and finally repeat the process with an individual word to see the translations in a final window. If you wish to see more words in the subcategory, or look at subcategories that belong to a different word category, simply close the windows in reverse order to which they appeared in the application. The windows are contained within the VBox of the word categories, but each sub window can be freely moved around the screen. To use the Lexical Similarity calculator, select a language from each ChoiceBox and press the “Calculate” button to reveal the similarity between your choices on a scale of 0 to 100%. The map of the family tree is meant to illustrate the genealogy of the family, to help visualize the similarities from a different perspective.
